# Code Reuse Thinking Guide

> **Purpose**: Stop and think before creating new code - does it already exist?

---

## The Problem

**Duplicated code is the #1 source of inconsistency bugs.**

When you copy-paste or rewrite existing logic:
- Bug fixes don't propagate
- Behavior diverges over time
- Codebase becomes harder to understand

---

## Before Writing New Code

### Step 1: Search First

```bash
# Search for similar function names
grep -r "functionName" .

# Search for similar logic
grep -r "keyword" .
```

### Step 2: Ask These Questions

| Question | If Yes... |
|----------|-----------|
| Does a similar function exist? | Use or extend it |
| Is this pattern used elsewhere? | Follow the existing pattern |
| Could this be a shared utility? | Create it in the right place |
| Am I copying code from another file? | **STOP** - extract to shared |

---

## Common Duplication Patterns

### Pattern 1: Copy-Paste Functions

**Bad**: Copying a validation function to another file

**Good**: Extract to shared utilities, import where needed

### Pattern 2: Similar Components

**Bad**: Creating a new component that's 80% similar to existing

**Good**: Extend existing component with props/variants

### Pattern 3: Repeated Constants

**Bad**: Defining the same constant in multiple files

**Good**: Single source of truth, import everywhere

---

## When to Abstract

**Abstract when**:
- Same code appears 3+ times
- Logic is complex enough to have bugs
- Multiple people might need this

**Don't abstract when**:
- Only used once
- Trivial one-liner
- Abstraction would be more complex than duplication

---

## After Batch Modifications

When you've made similar changes to multiple files:

1. **Review**: Did you catch all instances?
2. **Search**: Run grep to find any missed
3. **Consider**: Should this be abstracted?

---

## Checklist Before Commit

- [ ] Searched for existing similar code
- [ ] No copy-pasted logic that should be shared
- [ ] Constants defined in one place
- [ ] Similar patterns follow same structure

## Gotcha: Python if/elif/else Exhaustive Check

**Problem**: Python's if/elif/else chains have no compile-time exhaustive check. When you add a new value to a `Literal` type (e.g., `Platform`), existing if/elif/else chains silently fall through to `else` with wrong defaults.

**Symptom**: New platform works partially — some methods return Claude defaults instead of platform-specific values. No error is raised.

**Example** (`cli_adapter.py`):
```python
# BAD: "gemini" falls through to else, returns "claude"
@property
def cli_name(self) -> str:
    if self.platform == "opencode":
        return "opencode"
    else:
        return "claude"  # gemini silently gets "claude"!

# GOOD: explicit branch for every platform
@property
def cli_name(self) -> str:
    if self.platform == "opencode":
        return "opencode"
    elif self.platform == "gemini":
        return "gemini"
    else:
        return "claude"
```

**Prevention**: When adding a new value to a Python `Literal` type, search for ALL if/elif/else chains that switch on that type and add explicit branches. Don't rely on `else` being correct for new values.

---

## Gotcha: Asymmetric Mechanisms Producing Same Output

**Problem**: When two different mechanisms must produce the same file set (e.g., recursive directory copy for init vs. manual `files.set()` for update), structural changes (renaming, moving, adding subdirectories) only propagate through the automatic mechanism. The manual one silently drifts.

**Symptom**: Init works perfectly, but update creates files at wrong paths or misses files entirely.

**Prevention checklist**:
- [ ] When migrating directory structures, search for ALL code paths that reference the old structure
- [ ] If one path is auto-derived (glob/copy) and another is manually listed, the manual one needs updating
- [ ] Add a regression test that compares outputs from both mechanisms

**See also**: `backend/platform-integration.md` → "collectTemplates path drift" for a concrete example.

## Template File Registration (Trellis-specific)

When adding new files to `src/templates/trellis/scripts/`:

**CRITICAL**: New script files must be registered in THREE places:

1. **`src/templates/trellis/index.ts`**:
   - Add `export const xxxScript = readTemplate("scripts/path/file.py");`
   - Add to `getAllScripts()` Map

2. **`src/commands/update.ts`**:
   - Add to import statement
   - Add to `collectTemplateFiles()` Map

**Why this matters**: Without registration, `trellis update` won't sync the file to user projects. Bug fixes and features won't propagate.

### Quick Checklist for New Scripts

```bash
# After adding a new .py file, verify:
grep -l "newFileName" src/templates/trellis/index.ts  # Should match
grep -l "newFileName" src/commands/update.ts          # Should match
```
